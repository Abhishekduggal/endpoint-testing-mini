# Project Summary


In this mini-project, we will learn about the basics of endpoint testing using Postman. Postman is a REST client that we will be making HTTP requests from. We will learn how to write Postman tests for the responses from the HTTP requests.

Postman docs: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_scripts

## Step 1

* Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies.
* Run `nodemon` in the terminal. The package.json file has already been configured to run the server file on the execution of the `nodemon` command.

## Step 2

### Summary

We will import a collection of requests to Postman.

### Instructions

* Open Postman.
* Click on the `import` button located in the top left corner of Postman.
  * The file you are importing is inside of the `postman_collection` folder in this repo.
* After importing, you should have a collection called `Endpoint Testing Mini`. If you click on it, the list of requests should expand/close.
